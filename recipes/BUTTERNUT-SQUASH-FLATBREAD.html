    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Place squash halves cut side up on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake squash for 50-60 minutes until brown and fork-tender. When the roasted squash is cool enough to handle, scoop the pulp into a large bowl.</li>
                <li>With an electric hand mixer blend in goat cheese, orange juice, sage, thyme, and nutmeg to the squash. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Increase oven heat to 425 degrees F. Place flatbread onto a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush the tops with a thin coating of olive oil. Bake 3-5 minutes to crisp the crust (skip this if you prefer a chewier crust).</li>
                        <li> Remove flatbread from oven and evenly spread on the squash mixture. <br>
                            Top with prosciutto, shallots, crumbles of remaining goat cheese, and sage leaves. Sprinkle with freshly grated parmesan.</li>
                            <li>Bake for 8-10 minutes until edges are crisp.</li>
                                <li>Finish with fresh cracked black pepper, additional parmesan, green onions and drizzle of honey. Enjoy!</li>
